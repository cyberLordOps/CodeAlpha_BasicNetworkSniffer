# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer
ðŸ“Œ Description

CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer is a minimalist packet-sniffing utility built in Python. It captures live network traffic at the transport and network layers and parses packet headers (IP, TCP/UDP, etc.) for protocol analysis, IP tracing, and port inspection.
Ideal for educational use, security testing, and low-level network debugging.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Capture live network packets.

Analyze source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols.

Understand the flow of data across a network.

Provide a lightweight tool for learning packet sniffing basics.

ðŸ“– Example Output

Source: 192.168.1.10 â†’ Destination: 142.250.190.78 | Protocol: TCP | Port: 443
Source: 192.168.1.10 â†’ Destination: 224.0.0.251   | Protocol: UDP | Port: 5353

ðŸ“š Additional Notes

HTTPS packets are encrypted; only metadata (IP, ports, protocol) is visible.

DNS queries and TCP handshakes are more readable.

Running requires admin/root privileges on most systems.
